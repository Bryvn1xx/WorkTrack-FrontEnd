## Task

Your task is to work as a team to build a full-stack `Postresql/Express/React/Node` application with a functioning backend and frontend with user authentication. 
Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience and be creative in your concept.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed ReadMe (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart, draw.io, etc.) for the frontend
- Trello Board that tells the development story of your app
- Pitch deck explaining your idea and it's practical use-case (Google Slides, Powerpoint, etc.) to be presented by your group on Monday (June 21)
- Project must be _well-scoped_, meaning that your team can capably reach MVP by the due date

## Project Approval Due Date: June 21st @ 10AM EST

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo** with *separate development branches* for **each** group member.
- Be a **realistic idea**. It cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from an online tutorial or walkthrough.
- Have separate directories for the frontend (client) and backend within the main repository.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **ReadMe.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
- Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include user authentication.
- Include a minimum of 3 Sequelize Models (models).
- At least one `1 to MANY` or `MANY to MANY` association.
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
- Use functional components with React hooks. Your project cannot have class components.
- Have at least **60 _meaningful_ `git` commits** - roughly 20 per member utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes to your branch every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). 
- Be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Project Due Date: June 25th @ 230PM EST

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Integrate a 3rd party API: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- Integrate a UI Library (Semantic, Material-UI, React-MD, react-rainbow, r-suite)
- Integrate Mapbox or Geolocation: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/
- Implement Data Visualization or Charting: https://dev.to/giteden/top-5-react-chart-libraries-for-2020-1amb

## Tips
- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration.
- Decide who will be git lead in your group and start brainstorming as soon as possible.
- Commit early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature).
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features.
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase on your portfolio - it could land you a job).
