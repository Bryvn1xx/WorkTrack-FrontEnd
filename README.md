## Task

Your task is to work as a team build a decoupled, full-stack `Postresql/Express/React/Node` application with a functioning backend and frontend. 
Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience and be creative in your concept.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed README (Title/Your Name, Description, How to Get Started, User Stories, Credits)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart or other) for the frontend
- User Stories explaining how a user interacts with your website (MVP)


## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be a **new repo** with separate development branches for each group member.
- Be a **new and original idea**, it cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from a tutorial.
- Have separate directories for the frontend (client) and backend within the main repository
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **README.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/))
- Include a minimum of 3 Sequelize Models (models)
- At least one `1 to MANY` or `MANY to MANY` association
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model
- Display database model data on the frontend
- Have at least 10 React components utilizing `useState` and `useEffect`. Your project cannot have class components.
- Have at least **60 _meaningful_ `git` commits** - roughly 20 per member through utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). 
- Comments should be in your code to describe what your functions are doing.
- Be deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) 

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Integrate a 3rd party API: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- Integrate image/file uploading: https://cloudinary.com/documentation
- Integrate sockets: https://socket.io/
- Integrate a UI Library (Bootstrap, Materialize, Material-UI, React-MD): https://material-ui.com/
- Integrate Mapbox or Geolocation: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/
- Implement Data Visualization or Charting: https://dev.to/giteden/top-5-react-chart-libraries-for-2020-1amb
- Add a search bar on your webpage and use the .filter() method
- Add a filter to your webpage (e.g. by color, by size, etc.)
- Create reusable components

## Tips

- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration
- Decide who will be gitmaster in your group and start brainstorming as soon as possible.
- Commit early (day one or two) and often (everytime you implement a new feature)
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase - it could land you a job)
- Use Google Fonts in your project. To do this, find a font on https://fonts.google.com/ , select the font, go to the *embed* link, and put its HTML tag in your HTML document's `<head>` tag, *above* your link to your CSS. You will then need to use its CSS Rule to apply it in your CSS file. Example:
- ```html
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Sansita+Swashed:wght@500&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./style.css">
  ```
